# Neural Networks for Student Loan Refinancing
Neural Networks for Classification, RBM and Recommendation Systems - Homework AI Bootcamp due 4/15/2025

## Project Overview
1. From student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb file, read the student-loans.csv file, follow instructions using SciKit's StandardScaler, create 2 hidden nodes and 1 neurons for the output layer
2. Display the Sequential Model summary
3. Compile and fit the model using binary_crossentropy, adam optimizer, and accuracy evaluation metric

## How I did my work
1. Follow the instructions on the Jupyter Notebook starter file
2. Use lesson 18_1, 18_2, and 18_3 for the command lines
3. Use Copilot Pro auto populated code
4. Debug and test multiple times

## Output Examples
See attached file student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb file
